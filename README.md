# Reservation-Checker-Covermanager
Reservation Checker Covermanager is an automated script designed to check the availability of reservations at a restaurant using the form created by CoverManager. This project notifies a Telegram group when new hours become available, making it easy for users to stay informed about reservations without the need for manual checking.
